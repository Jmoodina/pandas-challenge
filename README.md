Assignment 4 PyCity Schools Analysis

District Summary: 
There are a total of 15 schools
A student count of 39170.
A total budget of over 83 million
Average passing math of 81%
Average passing reading of 75%
And an overall passing rate of 85

The top 5 highest performing schools are all charter-type schools

The bottom 5 worst performing schools are all district-type schools with a school size between 2000-5000 students.


Conclusions:
- Charter school types are doing a lot better than District school types with an Overall Passing difference of about 40% in favor of Charter school types.
When looking at school size. The larger population with a school size of 2000-5000 significantly decreases the passing percentage overall. 
This leaves me with the conclusion that more populated district-type schools have a negative structure that affects the students poorly. 

- Looking at the spending ranges(per student). Students with a lower spending budget perform better than students with a higher spending budget.
In conclusion the performance of students are inversely related to the school's spending per student.

Something you might want to note is that my per_summary_school is under the code summary_school

Wanted to remove any unwanted warnings. This was where I found the code.
